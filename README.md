EconData
========

R package containing a host of datasets useful for economic research. Complete with raw data and cleaning functions. 

Notice that I don't have the resulting .RData files here on github. 
Those are binary files which would blow up the repository. You can 
build all datafiles with the function `makeAllData()`.

This is R package version of the repository at 
[https://github.com/floswald/Rdata](https://github.com/floswald/Rdata), which I will discontinue in due course.
